# kookit

Kookit is a flutter based mobile Application. The backend is built on DotNet. MongoDb is used as the database. The idea of the app is to create an app for a cooking robot. You can specify minor ingredients and as well you can choose to use the recommended ingredients. We have a library of recipes you can try with the robot. To sync in with the robot you need to scan the QR Code of the device and you are good to go.
